 Piles, also known as hemorrhoids, are swollen veins in and around the rectum that can cause itching, pain, and even bleeding. Many people suffer from piles, but not everyone knows how to treat them or when to seek medical help. The good news is that you can manage mild cases of piles at home with some simple steps. However, for more severe cases or complications, it’s important to consult a specialist.
At Goyal Piles Laser Centre, we specialize in treating piles, fissures, and fistulas.
Led by Dr. Sushil Goyal, we provide expert care to help you manage and treat these conditions. 
Let’s go over some home remedies you can try and when you should come to our clinic for treatment.
Home Remedies for Piles
If you're dealing with mild piles, here are some ways to manage them at home:
1. Eat More Fiber
A diet rich in fiber helps make your stools softer and easier to pass, reducing strain. Include foods like:
Whole grains
Fruits (such as apples, pears, and bananas)
Vegetables (like broccoli and carrots)
Beans and lentils
2. Drink Plenty of Water
Staying hydrated helps prevent constipation, which can make piles worse. Try to drink 8-10 glasses of water every day.
3. Warm Sitz Baths
Soaking the affected area in warm water for 10-15 minutes a few times a day can help soothe pain and reduce swelling. This is a simple but effective way to feel better.
4. Use Topical Creams
Over-the-counter creams and ointments can provide temporary relief from itching and burning. Look for products that contain hydrocortisone or witch hazel.
5. Don’t Strain
Straining when using the bathroom can make piles worse.
Try not to sit for too long and avoid pushing hard when passing stools. 
Listening to your body’s signals and going to the bathroom when needed can also help prevent constipation.
6. Get Moving
Exercise, even a simple daily walk, can improve your bowel health and help prevent constipation.
7. Cold Compresses
Applying a cold compress or ice pack to the affected area can reduce swelling and ease pain. Just make sure to wrap the ice in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.
When to Visit Goyal Piles Laser Centre
While home remedies can help with mild piles, sometimes you may need professional treatment. Here are some signs that it’s time to see a doctor:
Ongoing bleeding: If you’re experiencing frequent or heavy bleeding, it’s important to get checked out.
Severe pain: If the pain from piles is too much to handle and home remedies aren’t helping, professional care is needed.
Prolapsed hemorrhoids: If your hemorrhoids are sticking out of the anus, they may need medical treatment.
Fissures or Fistulas: Anal fissures (painful tears) or fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the anus and skin) require special care and treatment.
