Piles: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention
Piles, also known as hemorrhoids, are swollen veins in the rectum and anus that cause discomfort, bleeding, and irritation. A common condition affecting millions globally, piles can significantly impact an individual's quality of life if left untreated. Understanding its causes, symptoms, and treatment options is crucial for effective management.

What are Piles?
Piles occur when the blood vessels in the anal area swell due to increased pressure. They can be classified into two types:
Internal Hemorrhoids: Located inside the rectum and typically painless, these may bleed during bowel movements.
External Hemorrhoids: Found under the skin around the anus, these are often painful and may itch or bleed.

Causes of Piles
Several factors contribute to the development of piles, including:
Chronic constipation: Straining during bowel movements increases pressure on rectal veins.
Sedentary lifestyle: Prolonged sitting or lack of exercise can contribute to poor blood circulation.
Pregnancy: Increased pressure on pelvic blood vessels during pregnancy may lead to piles.
Obesity: Excess weight exerts additional pressure on the lower rectum.
Dietary factors: A low-fiber diet can cause hard stools and straining.

Symptoms of Piles
The symptoms of piles vary depending on their type and severity. Common signs include:
Bright red blood after a bowel movement.
Pain or discomfort in the anal area.
Swelling or a lump near the anus.
Itching or irritation around the anus.
Mucus discharge during bowel movements.
If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare provider. For expert advice, visit Goyal Piles Care Centre, your trusted piles clinic, for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs.

Treatment Options
Treatment depends on the severity of the condition:
Lifestyle Changes:
Increase dietary fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.
Avoid straining during bowel movements.
Incorporate regular exercise to improve blood circulation.
Home Remedies:
Warm sitz baths can soothe irritation.
Over-the-counter creams and ointments help reduce inflammation and discomfort.
Medical Interventions:
Non-surgical treatments: Rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or infrared coagulation may be used for mild to moderate cases.
Surgical options: In severe cases, hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy may be recommended.

Prevention
Preventing piles is easier than treating them. Adopt a healthy lifestyle with a fiber-rich diet, regular exercise, and good bowel habits. Avoid sitting for prolonged periods, and manage conditions like constipation promptly.
